All Programming Cards
==================================================

Kart-ON's recognizer extracts the text on the cards and the interpreter use this text to generate some piece of Javascript source file. Kart-ON is an attribute based programming language, which means the language consists of some attributes and some drawing elements. To define the properties of drawing elements we specify the attribute first. For example, if you want to draw a green square and an orange circle:

.. image:: ../image/example_1.jpg
   :width: 50%

Block List

1. `Group Cards`_
2. `Fill`_

Group Cards
============

Use the card to save the code under a group name. For example, you organized a classroom with six groups and you want to assign their code to specific categories in your mobile application. If you place this card in the beginning or end of the code, you can automatically assign the code work under the group name.

.. image:: ../image/variable_list.png
   :width: 50%

Fill
======

Use the card to define the color of the shapes.
